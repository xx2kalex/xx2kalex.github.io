            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi everyone, my name is Alex Shpakov and I am a junior CS major from suburban Chicago. Some of my hobbies
                and interests include lifting, playing basketball, and watching the Bulls and Bears. Over the summer I
                worked as a software engineering intern at a communications company based out of Chicago, IL and also
                did quite a bit of traveling to places such as London, England and Traverse City, Michigan.
                When I graduate I hope to work as a software engineer or in a software-engineer-adjacent position for
                a company in an industry that interests me.</p>

            <p>There are two main qualities of a 'bad' website in my opinion, these being a lack of responsiveness
                and ambiguity in terms of finding what I need. A lack of responsiveness in a website is a productivity
                killer to the user because they are forced to spend extra time on the website to complete a task that
                should otherwise be completed in a more efficient manner. One example that I could think of for this
                was the nba.com website a few years ago. Although after just checking it now it does not seem to be a
                problem anymore, it used to be very slow pulling up box scores of recent games and essentially any
                data-heavy information that was not on the landing page. This was a problem because it turned users
                like me away from using that website as my go-to source for searching up stats of recent games.</p>

            <p>The other problem, ambiguity in terms of finding what I need is an issue because it also causes me to
                spend more time and thus energy on finding what I need, which can deter users away from a website.
                An example that I found is lingscars.com, a car leasing website based in the UK.
                This website is extremely busy and just by looking at it, it is impossible to distinguish one thing
                from another without spending extra energy to look at it closely.
                That is an obvious problem that would deter users. </p>
